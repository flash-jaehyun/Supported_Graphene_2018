Trying a variety of root cuts of the FCC 111 surface to obtain low strain graphene mono-layers

The following slab had the lowest strain:

03_1_root Strain: 0.37961748258013933


The approximate optimal spacing between the graphene layer and the surface was
found in the following job_dir:
matr.io/model/qe/3/u/raulflores/fe-graph-proj/supp-graph/struct-opt/01-fcc111-rootcut-graph/1-att

For those calculations all atoms were constrained and the optimal graphen-
surface spacing was found to be:

OPTIMAL GRAPHENE SURFACE SPACING: 1.885 Angstroms
